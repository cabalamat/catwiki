# About CatWiki

CatWiki is very simple wiki software that stores its articles as text files.

## Features

* Stores articles as text files, so they are easy to back up and manipulate. Even if the wiki software goes down, you can still get at your notes.
* Uses an enhanced version of the the Markdown markup language.
* Allows multiple wikis per installation, each one in its own directory.
* Allows subdirectories. You can navigate through the directories using the web interface. If the directory includes image files, the web page shows thumbnails of them.
* You can add Font Awesome icons in your wiki pages.

## Technology Used

CatWiki is written in Python and uses the Flask lightweight web framework.
