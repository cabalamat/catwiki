# Ideas for features to add

**Discusses some features that could be added to the system**.

## Upvoting / downvoting

Like on Reddit. But with a twist: when I upvote a post the system looks at all the other people who've upvoted the same post, and calculates their upvotes to other posts higher.

This means that every user will have their own personalised upvote-scote for each post. 

Upvoting doesn't work very well with the decentralised nature of some aspects of the system, but it might be made to work when the system is a centralised website.

## Something like Instagram

Where you can take a photo and quickly sent it to all your followers

(Needs to be an app as well as a website; possibly have more than one app).

## RSS feeds

The app should be both a consumer and producer of RSS feeds.
