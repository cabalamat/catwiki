SiteBox is my project for a combined wiki/blog platform.

## [[Goals of SiteBox]]

The overall goal of SiteBox is to be an all-encompassing platform where people can communicate and collaborate over the Internet. 

This overall goal is split into numerous use-cases, not all of which will be implemented at once.
