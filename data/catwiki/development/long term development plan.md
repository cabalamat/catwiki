# Long term development plan

*See also [SiteBox To-do List](todo) for a more short-term to-do list*.

Get the wiki working as a standalone home wiki.

Add users, so the system can be put on a public-facing website. A user can create new sites and can administer which other users can edit those sites.

Add [[versioning]].

Add blogging/messaging (like the old meowcat).

Add auto-synchronise so that a user can have a replica of a public site on their local computer. The two sites would auto-synchronise. If the site is one they have write-access to, then editing their local site should push changes to the public one. Communication should be encrypted.

Add messaging from private site to private site. Communication should be encrypted. This would include messaging as well as wiki updates.
