CatWiki is very simple wiki software that stores its articles as text files. It was originally called *SiteBox*.

## Features

* Stores articles as text files, so they are easy to back up and manipulate. Even if the wiki software goes down, you can still get at your notes.
* Uses an [enhanced](CatWiki enhancements to Markdown) version of the the [[Markdown]] markup language
* Allows [[multiple wikis]] per installation, each one in its own directory.
* Allows subdirectories. You can navigate through the directories using the web interface. If the directory includes image files, the web page shows thumbnails of them.
* You can add [<i class="fa fa-font-awesome"></i> Font Awesome icons](http://fontawesome.io/icons/) in your wiki articles.
